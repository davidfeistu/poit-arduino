Arduino code for final project

The code is designed to read data from temperature and humidity sensors and calculate the distance based on these values. The parking sensor increases the beep sound based on the distance, with data being sent via the serial port. Values received from the serial port can also be used to control the settings.

The aim of this project is to provide a solution for monitoring and controlling environmental conditions in a parking area, allowing for effective management of temperature, humidity, and distance measurements.
